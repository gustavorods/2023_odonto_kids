SMTP_HOST=""
SMTP_PORT=
SMTP_USER=""
SMTP_PASSWORD=""
SMTP_AUTH=""

P.S: DO NOT USE THE WORD "USER" AS THE VARIABLE NAME.
The default operating system environment variable called USER usually stores the system username, so it will return the system username, instead of the value you stored.
And also because it is a very obvious name ;)
